/**
 * Estimate the number of servings
 * -------------------------------
 * Description
 * A real coffee machine doesn't have an infinite supply of water, milk, or coffee beans. If you request too many cups
 * of coffee, it's almost certain that a real coffee machine wouldn't have enough supplies to fulfill the order.
 * In this stage, you need to improve the previous stage program. Now you will check amounts of water, milk, and coffee
 * beans available in the coffee machine at the moment.
 * -------------------------------
 * Objectives
 * Write a program that does the following:
 * 1. Requests the amounts of water, milk, and coffee beans available at the moment, and then asks for the number of cups
 * of coffee a user needs.
 * 2. If the coffee machine has enough supplies to make the specified amount of coffee, the program should print "Yes, I can
 * make that amount of coffee".
 * 3. If the coffee machine can make more than the requested amount, the program should output "Yes, I can make that amount
 * of coffee (and even N more than that)", where N is the number of additional cups of coffee that the coffee machine can
 * make.
 * 4. If the available resources are insufficient to make the requested amount of coffee, the program should output "No, I
 * can make only N cup(s) of coffee".
 * Like in the previous stage, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffee beans to make
 * one cup of coffee.
 * -------------------------------
 * Note: As you work through each stage of the project, please ensure to remove any code from previous stages that is no
 * longer needed. Keeping your code clean and focused on the specific objectives of each stage will enhance clarity and
 * improve the overall structure of your project.
 * As you work through this project, each stage focuses on specific programming concepts, which may create a sense of
 * disconnection. This approach is intentional, allowing you to build your skills gradually without overwhelming
 * complexity. By completing each stage independently, you reinforce individual skills that will be integrated into a
 * cohesive project later.
