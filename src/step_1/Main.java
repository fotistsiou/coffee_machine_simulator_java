/**
 * Make a first cup
 * ----------------
 * Description
 * Let's start with a program that makes you a coffee â€“ virtual coffee, of course. In this project, you will implement
 * functionality that simulates a real coffee machine. It can run out of ingredients, such as milk or coffee beans, it
 * can offer you various types of coffee, and, finally, it will take money for the prepared drink. Throughout the project,
 * you'll learn how to manage ingredients, take user input, and make decisions based on those inputs.
 * This stage introduces basic console output that represents the process of making a cup of coffee. In the next stages,
 * you will improve the program by adding user interaction and resource management.
 * ----------------
 * Objective
 * The first version of the program just makes you a coffee. Your task is to simulate the coffee-making process by
 * printing each step to the console, showing what the coffee machine does as it makes the drink.
