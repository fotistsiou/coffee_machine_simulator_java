## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don‚Äôt have to make yourself. It‚Äôs enough to 
press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

In this project, you'll program a coffee machine simulator using Java. The machine works with typical products: coffee, 
milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: 
espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing‚Äôs for free, it also collects the money.

This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and 
attributes, and get a taste of Java. Practice working with methods, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and 
get more confident with OOP.

## What you'll learn
Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course 
to get it built. Here‚Äôs what awaits you:

- Stage 1/6: Make a first cup
  - Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a 
    cup of coffee!
  - Stage Topics:
    - Introduction to Java
    - Basic literals: numbers, strings and characters
    - Writing first program
    - Printing data
- Stage 2/6: Calculate the ingredients
  - Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
  - Stage Topics:
    - Types and variables
    - Comments
    - Reading user's input with Scanner
    - Coding style conventions
    - Naming variables
    - Arithmetic operations
    - Integer types and operations
    - Increment and decrement
    - Characters
    - String
    - Write, compile, and run
    - Basic terms: JVM, JRE, JDK
    - Operating systems
    - Command line overview
    - Parameters and options
    - Running programs on your computer
- Stage 3/6: Estimate the number of servings
  - Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of 
    ingredients we enter.
  - Stage Topics:
    - 
- Stage 4/6: Add functions to your machine
  - Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve 
    the coffee.
  - Stage Topics:
    - 
- Stage 5/6: Keep track of the supplies
  - Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps 
    updating until you enter ‚Äúexit‚Äù.
  - Stage Topics:
    - 
- Stage 6/6: Brush up your code
  - Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
